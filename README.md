# Notes: Web Development with Node.js 

## Notes: html, css, js, Node.js, React, Express

Includes all the important notes made while learning Web Dev. These are **references** I use to revise when I need revision. There is no step-by-step notes!

Every `git branch` has its own project. Latest `.md` extension file within that `branch` contains notes to understand and practice the particular topic.
