# Database Normalization with PostgreSQL

# Introduction To Normalization

Imagine that you are tasked with designing a database to store student, faculty, and curriculum information at a college. Currently, the school is storing data in a single table. Each row of the table represents an individual student; the column names are listed in the schema below: ![](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/data-engineering-postgres/database-normalization-with-postgresql/college_nonnorm.png)

In the following exercises, we will examine some of the inefficiencies associated with the structure of this table and think about possible ways to remedy the situation.

The process of restructuring a database in this way is called _normalization_. If you look up “database normalization,” you’ll see that there are formal names and definitions for different levels of restructuring; the most common are first, second, and third normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF). In practice, the formal vocabulary tends to be used in academic settings, and would be important to understand if you want to read a paper about how to optimize your database schema. Database engineers think about the underlying concepts of normalization on a day-to-day basis, but rarely use the technical names and definitions. This lesson is therefore focused on the ideas behind normalization, rather than the formal vocabulary (although we encourage you to do your own research if you are interested in learning more!).

Before we get started unpacking the `college` table described above, let’s first query it to get a sense of the data. Remember that you can return all columns of a table using `SELECT *` and limit the number of rows using `LIMIT`. For example, the following query would return the first 5 rows of a table called `products`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 5;
```

## Duplicated Data

Let’s now examine the `college` table from exercise 1 more closely. The primary key of this table is `student_id` (a unique student identifier), and most of the columns describe characteristics of students, including their:

*   name
*   class year
*   email
*   major(s)
*   advisor

This table also contains columns that do not describe students directly. For example, the columns `advisor_name`, `advisor_department`, `advisor_building`, and `advisor_email` describe further details about **advisors**; meanwhile, `major_1_credits_reqd` and `major_2_credits_reqd` describe further detail about **majors**.

When columns of a database table do not depend on (i.e., describe) the primary key, the same data may be duplicated in multiple places. For example, all students who share an advisor will have the same information listed in these four advisor-related columns. In future exercises, we will see how this can cause problems related to data modification. For now, let’s query the table to examine the duplication.

Remember that you can use a `WHERE` clause within a `SELECT` statement to return rows of a table where a particular condition is met. For example, the following query would return all sophomore student names and emails:

```sql
SELECT student_name, student_email
FROM college
WHERE student_year = 'sophomore';
```


## Data Update Challenges

In the last exercise, we saw that the `college` table contains duplicated data. This can be especially problematic if we want to modify the duplicated information, because we’ll have to make the same updates in multiple locations.

For example, suppose that a faculty member named Professor `'Hill'` changes their email address to `'hill@college.edu'` and asks you to update the school database accordingly. Since multiple students may have Professor Hill as an advisor, you’ll need to update her email address in multiple rows of the table. To do this, your first instinct might be something like:

```


UPDATE college
SET advisor_email = 'hill@college.edu'
WHERE advisor_name = 'Hill';


```

Unfortunately, this could cause problems if there are multiple professors with the same name. For example, suppose we run the code above, then query the table for all rows where `advisor_name = 'Hill'` and observe the following result:

| **advisor_name** | **advisor_department** | **advisor_email** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hill | Biology | [hill@college.edu](mailto:hill@college.edu) |
| Hill | English | [hill@college.edu](mailto:hill@college.edu) |
| … | … | … |

  

Oh no! We accidentally modified two professors’ emails when we only intended to change one. If advisor information were housed in a separate table, we could have imposed a `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY` constraint on the `advisor_email` column to make sure that no two advisors have the same emails recorded in our database; however, this was not possible in the current design, since we needed to store duplicate emails for all students with the same advisor. Our database is not well protected against modification errors!


## Data Insertion Challenges

Let’s again consider the `college` table. In the last exercise, we saw how data duplication can complicate database modification. Unfortunately, there is another potential problem that can arise when all columns in a table do not depend on the primary key: new data cannot be inserted into the table until a primary key is known.

Suppose, for example, that the school hires a new advisor in the Computer Science department. The advisor’s name is Professor Algorithm and his email is [algorithm1000@college.edu](mailto:algorithm1000@college.edu). Unfortunately, we cannot add a new row to this database table because Professor Algorithm has not been assigned to advise any students yet — and we need a primary key (associated with an individual student) in order to insert a new row of data.

To get around this problem, we could theoretically come up with a fake student ID and leave non-relevant columns empty. For example, assuming that the database is set-up to assign `NULL` values by default to every non-key column, we could use the following code to insert Professor Algorithm’s information into the database:

```sql
INSERT INTO college 
(student_id, advisor_name, advisor_department, advisor_email)
VALUES 
(-1, 'Algorithm', 'Computer Science', 'algorithm1000@college.edu');
```

The problem here is that we had to create a fake student ID in order to put Professor Algorithm into our table! This is bad because we can no longer use a simple count of unique student IDs to accurately determine the number of students who are enrolled. We’ll also have to remember to modify or delete this row in the future when Professor Algorithm starts advising students. Otherwise, we’ll open ourselves up to future mistakes and inconsistencies (for example, if we later want to know how many students Professor Algorithm advises, we might accidentally count this fake student as a real person).

## Search and Sort Efficiency

Again consider the `college` table. Besides the fact that the major-related columns are not directly dependent on the primary key, you may also notice that there are two sets of columns where a student’s major (and related information) can be recorded. This structure can make queries related to a student’s major less efficient (and more messy). For example, suppose that your boss is interested in figuring out which majors are most popular. They ask you to produce a table of unique majors along with the number of students who have declared each one, sorted by popularity.

If all information about student majors were contained in a single column (eg., `major_1`), this would be relatively simple:

```sql
SELECT major_1, count(*)
FROM majors
GROUP BY major_1
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

The first few rows returned by the query above would look something like:

| **count** | **major_1** |
| --- | --- |
| 53 | History |
| 49 | Political Science |
| 49 | Computer Science |
| 49 | English |
| 47 | Spanish |
| 46 | Geology |

The problem is that these counts are incorrect — they completely ignore majors recorded in the `major_2` column! To remedy this, we’ll have to join the `major_1` and `major_2` columns together somehow, creating additional complexity.

## Restructuring the Advisor Columns

Up to this point, we have examined problems with this database design and implications for queries and modifications. In this exercise, we’ll start to redesign our database to address some of these problems.

First, we saw that every student with the same advisor has identical information recorded in all advisor-related columns in the `college` table. One way to address this is by moving the four advisor-related columns into their own table, with only one row per unique advisor. This helps ensure every table has its own purpose or concern.

To create a new table from an existing one, we can precede any query with `CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS`. For example, the following code selects the unique values of `major_1` and `major_1_credits_reqd` from the original `college` table and inserts them into a newly created table called `majors`:

```
CREATE TABLE majors AS
SELECT distinct major_1, major_1_credits_reqd
FROM college;
```

We can also delete columns from our original table once we have moved them. For example, the following code drops the columns `major_1` and `major_1_credits_reqd` from the college table:

```
ALTER TABLE college
DROP COLUMN major_1, 
DROP COLUMN major_1_credits_reqd;
```


## Restructuring the Major Columns

We saw in the previous exercises that there are two potential issues with the four major-related columns in the `college` table:

1.  The two `_credits_reqd` columns describe the majors themselves, rather than the students, creating duplication
2.  The repeating sets of columns make it challenging to search and sort our data by major.

To address these problems, we can extract the four major-related columns to create two new tables:

*   A `majors` table listing each unique major and the number of credits required
*   A cross-reference table that matches students with majors. Note that we need two additional tables (as opposed to one) because the relationship between students and majors is many-to-many (multiple students can have the same major and each student can have multiple majors), while each major has only one value of `credits_reqd`.

After creating these two new tables, student and major data will be stored in three smaller tables that are related as follows:

![](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/data-engineering-postgres/database-normalization-with-postgresql/stud_maj_studmaj.png)

  

The first few rows of these tables might look something like:

*   `students` (student-specific data):

| **student_id** | **full_name** | **student_year** | **student_email** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Joshua Davis | senior | [Joshua1@college.edu](mailto:Joshua1@college.edu) |
| 2 | Ricardo Sansburn | junior | [Ricardo2@college.edu](mailto:Ricardo2@college.edu) |
| 3 | Waneesa el-Zakaria | freshman | [Waneesa3@college.edu](mailto:Waneesa3@college.edu) |
| 4 | Selena Mendoza | freshman | [Selena4@college.edu](mailto:Selena4@college.edu) |

  

*   `majors` (major-specific data):

| **major** | **credits_reqd** |
| --- | --- |
| Statistics | 13 |
| Data Science | 16 |
| Art History | 15 |
| Neuroscience | 16 |

  

*   `students_majors` (student-major pairs):

| **student_id** | **major** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Chemistry |
| 1 | Sociology |
| 2 | Sociology |
| 3 | Data Science |

  

If you look carefully at that last table, you’ll see that the student with `student_id = 1` (Joshua Davis) is listed in two rows of the `students_majors` table: one row for each of his majors.

## Creating Versus Modifying a Database Schema

In the last few exercises, we used columns in an existing database table (with data already inserted) to create three new tables, then dropped the redundant information from our original table. While this kind of table and schema modification can (and does) happen, it is much easier (and often preferable) to implement a schema design before data has been inserted into a database. This is because existing data might already violate constraints that we would like to impose under a new structure.

Moving and dropping columns is also not quite enough to turn the single `college` table from exercise 1 into the four-table version we likely would have designed if starting with no existing tables or data. For example, the two figures below show the original schema (with a single `college` table) compared to a normalized version with four tables.

non-normalized version:

![](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/data-engineering-postgres/database-normalization-with-postgresql/college_nonnorm.png)

compared to the normalized version:

![](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/data-engineering-postgres/database-normalization-with-postgresql/college_normal.png)

In the previous exercises, we created tables similar to the ones in the four-table schema described above; however, there are some important differences. For example:

*   The `advisor_name` column is renamed `name` in the `advisors` table, because it is already clear that everything within that table describes advisors.
*   The `college` table is renamed `students` because all non-student-related data has now been moved to other tables.
*   The primary keys in the `advisors`, `students`, and `majors` tables are now unique integer values. While it is valid to use `advisor_email` as a primary key in the `advisors` table, it can make things more difficult when we want to update or delete an email address.

In the four-table schema, we’ll also want to implement some constraints that were either not necessary or not possible in the original version. For example:

*   We can now implement a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `email` column of the `advisors` table, ensuring that no two advisors have the same email listed.
*   We can also enforce a foreign key constraint on the `advisor_id` column of the `students` table so that each `advisor_id` in that table matches an `id` in the `advisors` table.

In this exercise, we’ll create the four-table version of this schema using `CREATE TABLE` statements (instead of by extracting, deleting, and renaming columns from the original `college` table). Remember that the following syntax can be used to create a pair of related tables with primary and foreign key constraints. The first line creates a `customers` table with `id` as the primary key; the second creates an `orders` table with `order_id` as the primary key and `customer_id` as a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `customers` table:

```
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  age integer
);
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id integer REFERENCES customers(id),
  price money
);
```

## Database Structure and Use

Throughout this lesson, we have seen how poor database structure can impact our ability to store, modify, and ask questions of our data. In the last few exercises, we saw some possible ways to modify our database to address these common problems. While it often makes sense to break up large tables in this way, there are no universal rules about the best way to design a database schema. Sometimes, the most important design consideration is how a database will be used in the future. For example, if a particular column of data is never going to be modified, then data duplication in that column is less problematic.

In order to see how the changes we implemented in this lesson have impacted our ability to work with our database, let’s return to some of the issues we encountered in previous exercises. Let’s see how the normalized four-table structure addresses some of these problems.

## Database Structure and Use (Continued)

In the last exercise, we saw how the normalized four-table database schema solved some important problems, but it’s worth noting that normalization does not exclusively make queries and modification easier. When we split a large database table into multiple smaller tables, some queries may actually become more complex. This generally happens when a particular question about the data now requires two or more tables to be joined back together. Usually, this added complexity is worth it in order to maintain simple database structure and data integrity via constraints, but it’s useful to understand the slight trade-off.

For example, suppose that we’ve now fully redesigned our original database to have the following structure:

![](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/data-engineering-postgres/database-normalization-with-postgresql/college_normal.png)

If we want to know how many students are advised by faculty in each department, we’ll have to join the `students` and `advisors` tables back together. To do this, we can select from both tables where the `advisor_id` column from the `students` table equals the `id` column from the `advisors` table. The following query will do the trick:

```


SELECT students.id as student_id, department as advisor_department
FROM students, advisors
WHERE students.advisor_id = advisors.id;


```

This gives us a table with student ids matched to advisor departments. The first few rows might look like this:

| **student_id** | **advisor_department** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Philosophy |
| 2 | Philosophy |
| 3 | Computer Science |

  

Next, we can alter this query slightly to count the number of students with advisors in each department. We can accomplish this using `COUNT` and `GROUP BY` as follows:

```
SELECT COUNT(students.id), advisors.department as advisor_department
FROM students, advisors
WHERE students.advisor_id = advisors.id
GROUP BY advisor_department;
```

This gives us what we want: a table showing the number of students advised by faculty in each department. Here are the first few rows:

| **count** | **advisor_department** |
| --- | --- |
| 68 | Computer Science |
| 53 | Environmental Science |
| 24 | Chemistry |

  

That wasn’t too complicated - but note that we could have accomplished the same thing by querying the original `college` table without any joins! In the exercises below, you’ll walk through another example of a query that requires joining tables back together.

------------

## Review

Let’s review what you have learned!

*   Repeating groups of columns and columns that are not dependent on the primary key of a table can cause problems related to:
    *   Duplicated data
    *   Data modification (updates/insertions)
    *   Querying
*   Database normalization is a process by which database tables are modified/restructured to address these problems
*   Database design can be modified after data has been entered, but it is usually easiest to design a normalized schema up front
*   It is important to keep database use in mind when designing an optimal database schema

In this final exercise, we’ve re-loaded the initial `college` table from exercise 1, as well as the 4 smaller tables from exercise 9 (`students`, `students_majors`, `majors` and `advisors`). Below are some questions you might try to answer with both database structures to better understand how they differ.
